- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I didn't have trouble installing flask or running a flask app, and I'm proud to say I copy and pasted no code. It always helps me learn when I don't copy and paste, especially when I also try to remember code as I switch between desktops.
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
I'm pretty fascinated by how seemlessly gitbash, anaconda, flask, and python interact with each other in VS Code Editor. The different command lines are really clicking for me. I also think it's cool how versatile flask can be. I think it's important to provide a human-friendly interface for interacting with a predictive model.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The most challenging part of today's work was troubleshooting errors associated with running the flask shell at the appropriate file location.
